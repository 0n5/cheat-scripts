Node.js Basics
==============

* Event driven, async, non-blocking I/O
* Does not use threading, where some code runs forcing other code to wait (blocking)
* Relies on callbacks to know when a task is completed
* Uses an event loop to achieve multi-tasking, a queue of events that need to be processed and their callbacks
